Using LakeAnalyzer to determine the Physics of Dorset Lakes

At this point, the only lake physics calculations I have made for the lakes in the Dorset Muskoka region are the depths of the top and bottom of the metalimnion in the lake. This was made possible using the RLakeAnalyzer package, developed by Luke Winslow (UW-Madison)

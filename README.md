Using LakeAnalyzer to determine the Physics of Dorset Lakes

At this point, the only lake physics calculations I have made for the lakes in the Dorset Muskoka region are the top and bottom depths of the the metalimnion in each lake. This was made possible using the RLakeAnalyzer package, developed by Luke Winslow (UW-Madison).
